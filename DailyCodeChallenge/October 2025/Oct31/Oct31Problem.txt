SpOoKy~CaSe

Given a string representing a variable name, convert it to "spooky case" using the following constraints:

    Replace all underscores (_), and hyphens (-) with a tilde (~).
    Capitalize the first letter of the string, and every other letter after that. Ignore the tilde character when counting. Make all other letters lowercase.

For example, given hello_world, return HeLlO~wOrLd.
